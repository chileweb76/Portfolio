I love Valentine’s Day stuff. That’s a little ironic coming from me, since my hubby Chris and I don’t really celebrate the holiday at all, but I love the crafty part of it. Maybe I secretly love pink more than I let on, or maybe I just loved working with JoyLynn of Blue Heart Scraps again, but Sweet Valentine has been created and I could not be happier!

Working with JoyLynn is always a joy. Her stuff is always beautiful and she’s just a hoot to boot. When we chose the colors for this collection, we knew it was a LOT of pink. We did NOT know that it was going to be so much fun.

Sweet Valentine is full to bursting with romance and love, and while there is a LOT of pink, there are also some neutrals which balances everything out and makes it easy to use for other things as well. The main kit is super fun, and the add ons make for beautiful pages and crafts. You will not want to miss this one!
