New at The Studio, Smitten. This one was so, so fun. It made me think of romance and travel and PARIS! I wanted it to be versatile enough to use on other pages too, but it’s pretty lovey. With tons of hearts and other mushy stuff, it is full to the brim of beautiful pieces for you to use on any kind of layout.

If you grab the bundle, you get all 8 pieces PLUS the free Washi Tape! All for only $8.

I’ve made a little freebie for you to celebrate the release of Smitten, too. I hope you’ll enjoy – just click on the image to download.
