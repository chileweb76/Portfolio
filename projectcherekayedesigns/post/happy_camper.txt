If you have known me for any time, you know that I love Shawna Clingerman. I took her Fearless Art Course back a few years ago, and it totally changed my life. The way I do art, the way I run my business, the way I treat myself, all changed for the better in that program. Now I get the privilege of working with her as her admin, and I get to continue to learn from her in every day life. It’s a beautiful thing, and I’m so thankful for her.

One of the things that I’ve learned from her is a daily journaling practice. (I use an Archer and Olive notebook.). This involves not only journaling about what’s going on in life and how I am, but I also plan my day and do some artsy stuff in there. It sets me up on the right foot. One thing Shawna does is use stickers, and boy, I jumped on that bandwagon. I use mostly printable stickers that I print on THIS PAPER here at home with my ink jet printer, and I have a whole folder to chose from. It makes my journal pretty, but it’s still easy enough for me to do, and the end result is something I’m really proud of and love.

So, I made another set of printable stickers! These are coordinating with my Happy Camper collection, and there are 3 sheets of 8.5×11 paper in PDF format for easy printing and cutting. They look great in journals and on other crafts too – like cards and scrapbooking pages – and I plan on doing birthday cards with these coming up very soon! They are on sale for 30% off for the first week, and you can find them HERE IN MY PERSONAL SHOP. I hope you’ll pick up a set to use in your crafting!

Which camper would you like to go camping in? I’d love to know your favorite!
